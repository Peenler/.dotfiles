Due to the nature of being a doppelganger, her mother left Phoebe with her father after she was born, to never reveal herself again. \nTarvik was a stoic man, and held very high expectations for Phoebe. Though he always pushed her, he also tore her down with harsh words of criticism. Due to this, Phoebe has always pushed herself to master whatever she chooses to do. She secretly sought to make her father proud.\nOver the years, Phoebe grew a natural gift toward music and performance. Her gigs began at quaint stage centers in the city to showcase her talents. But she quickly gained attention due to her ability to effortlessly shapeshift into different personas. Because of all the people who knew her, she became a bit overwhelmed and took on an alter form to maintain her private identity. Before she knew it, she was dancing and playing for the nobles at their luxurious functions as a persona named Maeve. She was 16 during this time.\nDuring said functions, Maeve's natural charm and confidence slid her smoothly into the likes of the higher class folk. She continued talking them up for years, impressing them with her delightfully articulate use of words and 'intellect'.  She was exceptionally good at mirroring their behaviors. \nWhen she turned 20 they eventually offered her a position among the Zonarian table as a courtier. \nPhoebe actually learned a lot of different languages and information about the realm as she tasked with the nobles. She not only gained many allies and familiar names, she also learned a lot of genuine knowledge and wisdom regarding the world and political issues. Her father was finally beginning to act proud of her and respected her more on top of it all.\nHowever, this lifestyle dragged Phoebe down over the years, as she was a free spirited individual at heart. She took on her real form when her shifts were over every day to hide from her \"Maeve\" name and her people around the city. \nEventually, she called for a hiatus and fled her city in search of an escapade. She avoided turning into Maeve as she is a rather well-known face throughout Donali.\n\n-Phoebe's alter ego (her famous face in Zonar/Dorali):\n\nMaeve Zabala (30y)\n\nA signature Zonarian appearance. Green haired human woman with dark blue eyes and pale skin. She has a similar facial and body structure to Phoebe's, but her limbs are shorter and more human-like.
